Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justinas/nba-players-data?resource=download

This dataset holds around ~20 stats for every single NBA player that has existed. With such a large amount of data we will be able to easily come up with a well-fleshed hypothesis. We chose this dataset because all of our group members are familiar with basketball and NBA players. Doing a study on basketball players will allow us to answer questions we previously had before and provide new insights.
